                   # 1: Check the format of all files and stop;     10: Proceed after checking all files
                   # 2: Check the format of GENO_FILE and stop;     20: Proceed after checking GENO_FILE
                   # 3: Check the format of SEQ_FILE and stop;      30: Proceed after checking SEQ_FILE

                   # 0: Perform LASER to estimate ancestry from sequencing data
                   # 1: Perform PCA on the reference genotypes (based on EVD) and output genetic relationship matrix
                   # 2: Perform PCA on the reference genotypes (memory efficient but slow algorithm)
                   # 3: Perform PCA on the reference genotypes (based on SVD) and output SNP weights/loadings

REF_SIZE           # Number of individuals randomly selected as the reference (must be a positive integer; default [sample size in the GENO_FILE])
